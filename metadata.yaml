description: The clock struck one. It was the tall standing clock in the front room
  of Pemberton's Hotel, and Pemberton's stands by the highway that runs by the coast
  of Long Island Sound. It is near the western edge of the village of Greenough, the
  gilt cupola of whose eminent steeple is noted by far-passing ships. On the beach
  are flimsy summer cottages, and hard beside them is the old harbour, guarded by
  its stone pier. Whalers and merchantmen used to tie up there a hundred years ago,
  where now only fishing boats come. The village lies back from the shore, and has
  three divisions, Newport Street, the Green, and the West End; of which the first
  is a broad street with double roads, and there are the post office and the stores;
  the second boasts of its gilt-cupolaed church; the third has the two distinctions
  of the cemetery and Pemberton's.
